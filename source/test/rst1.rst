=============
What is Dash?
=============

Dash aims to be the most user-friendly and scalable payments-focused
cryptocurrency in the world. The Dash network features
:ref:`instant transaction confirmation <instantsend>`, double spend
protection, :ref:`anonymity <privatesend>` equal to that of physical
cash, a
:ref:`self-governing, self-funding model <decentralized-governance>`
driven by :ref:`incentivized full nodes <masternode-network>` and a
`clear roadmap <https://www.dash.org/roadmap/>`_ for on-chain scaling to
up to 400MB blocks using custom-developed open source hardware. While
Dash is based on Bitcoin and compatible with many key components of the
Bitcoin ecosystem, its two-tier network structure offers significant
improvements in transaction speed, anonymity and governance. This
section of the documentation describes these and many more key features
that set Dash apart in the blockchain economy.
